# testingSonarQube
This repo uses a code from a testing app built using SpringBoot and Maven for a SonarQube analysis test.
I do not run the app, I just run the sonarqube analysis to check security, reliability and maintainability issues, where in the code they are and to analyse the result of the analysis.
